<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>This Node.js project was built using the Cloud9 IDE which can be found on c9.io, but this same repository works if you install everything needed using npm</p>

<p>This example showcases basic node modules and a static express server.</p>

<h4>Running the server</h4>

<p>1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu (Cloud9 IDE Only).
<br>
2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:
<br>
    $ node server.js
<br>
Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.<p>
